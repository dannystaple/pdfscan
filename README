This software is a Perl based command line tool to allow easy processing of
multi-page paper documents into PDFs on Linux, using the default SANE scanner.

It and its source are available here for projects,
but the gscan2pdf software and equivalents now perform a superb job
and are available in all distributions.

As such, pdfscan will no longer be maintained or developed.
